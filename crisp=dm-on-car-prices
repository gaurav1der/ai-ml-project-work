Using CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) to predict old car prices

Here's how each phase applies to predicting old car prices:

1. Business Understanding:
Define the problem: What is the goal of predicting old car prices? Is it for valuation, pricing strategies, or market analysis? 
Determine objectives: What specific questions need to be answered? For example, "What is the price range for a 1970s Mustang in good condition?" 
Assess situation: What data sources are available? What are the constraints and resources? 
Produce project plan: Outline the steps, timelines, and resources needed for the project. 
Number of previous owners
Involved in accidents? if yes, how many?

2. Data Understanding:
Collect initial data:
. Gather data from sources like online marketplaces, dealerships, and auction sites.
Describe data:
. Understand the format, structure, and content of the data (e.g., make, model, year, mileage, condition, features, price).
Explore data:
. Analyze the data to understand distributions, relationships, and potential issues (e.g., outliers, missing values).
Verify data quality:
. Check for errors, missing values, and inconsistencies in the data. 
3. Data Preparation:
Select data: Choose the relevant variables (features) for prediction. 
Clean data: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This might involve imputation, deletion, or transformation of data. 
Construct data: Create new features from existing ones if needed (e.g., age of the car, engine size). 
Integrate data: Combine data from multiple sources if necessary. 
Format data: Ensure data is in the correct format for modeling (e.g., numerical, categorical). 
4. Modeling:
Select modeling techniques:
Choose appropriate algorithms for predicting car prices (e.g., regression models like linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods like random forest or gradient boosting). 
Generate test design: Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. 
Build model: Train the chosen model(s) on the training data. 
Assess model:Evaluate the performance of the model on the test data using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, R-squared). 
5. Evaluation:
Evaluate results: Assess whether the model meets the business objectives. 
Review process: Identify areas for improvement in the model or data preparation. 
Determine next steps: Decide whether to refine the model, explore different algorithms, or gather more data. 
6. Deployment:
Plan deployment: Determine how the model will be used in practice (e.g., integrating it into a website, generating reports). 
Plan monitoring: Establish a plan to monitor the model's performance over time and retrain it if necessary. 
Produce final report: Summarize the project findings and recommendations. 
Review project: Reflect on the overall project and identify lessons learned. 

TDSP is similar to CRISP-DM but adds an emphasis on team roles and collaborative workflows
OSEMN Framework: OSEMN (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, Interpret) is a more focused framework that emphasizes the core data science task

I used part of TDSP in this research as below

Define Objectives: Collaborate with stakeholders to identify the business problem (e.g., predicting used car prices) and its requirements.

Data Acquisition and Understanding: 
Ingest Data: Collect data from the identified sources and load it into the chosen analytics environment.
